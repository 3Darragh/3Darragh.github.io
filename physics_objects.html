				What are Physics Objects?
			</h2>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
					Physics objects are any object or mesh which are acted upon by the physics engine. This is split into two 
					categories, rigid bodies and mass aggregates. Rigid bodies are objects which are not deformable and capable of 
					rotation, while mass aggregates are the opposite, being moldable but incapable of rotation. While they seem 
					simple in their features and differences, they contain many nuanced complexities which make them useful in 
					different purposes.

						Rigid Bodies
					</h2>
					
					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
						Rigid bodies are solid, non-deformable, rotatable objects with a fixed structure. This means that opposite
						vertices along an edge remain a fixed distance apart, and same for edges along a face. These fixed distances
						allow them to be easier to compute for all aspects of collision detection, as if the bounding volume can
						rotate, then it never needs to be recalculated, unlike with mass aggregates. Rotation is applied to rigid
						bodies with quaternions, which add a lot of complexity in how they work. Below is a list of different ways
						rigid bodies rotate within the engine.
					</p>
					
					<ul class="main_bullet_points"> 
						<li>
							Torque
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									Torque is the rotational force applied onto a rigid body at some distance from the bodies center.
									It's found by multiplying a vector representing the objects force, by the vector representing the
									objects center and the position of applied force.
								</li>
								<li>
									Torque is directly responsible for finding the objects angular velocity, determined by the objects
									moment of inertia and mass. Torque is cumulative, and updates angular velocity every frame, even if
									there is no change in torque.
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Angular Velocity:
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									Angular velocity is the rigid bodies rate and axis of rotation. It consists of just one Vec4 whose direction
									represents the rotation axis and the magnitude represents the angular speed. Unlike torque which applies
									the force directly to the rigid body, angular velocity applies velocity to the inertia tensor.
								</li>
								<li>
									As torque contributes to angular velocity, angular velocity contributes to the bodies orientation. It is
									integrated upon over time and converted to a quaternion, which has the same struct as a Vec4. Angular velocity
									is not applied every frame, unlike torque, as it's only applied when the orientation needs to change.
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Orientation:
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									Orientation is the current rotational state of the rigid body relative to it's default position in the world.
									It is represented by a quaternion, which contains three complex numbers and one real number. The quaternion's 
									complex components represent different axes, affected by the euclidian components of the angular velocity vector.
									The real scalar component scales how much it needs to rotate by, affected by the vectors homogeneous component.
								</li>
								<li>
									It is not updated every frame, as if no force is applied, there is no point doing checks to update the orientation.
									This is the end point of the objects rotation, as unlike torque or angular velocity, it doesn't move into another
									aspect of rotation.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

					<h2>
						Mass Aggregates
					</h2>
					
					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
						Mass aggregates are objects consisting of small nodes that are conected to eachother through constraints. Each node has a mass,
						and can move on their own. This means that unlike rigid bodies, if a certain area of an aggregate is hit, it only that portion
						and it's neighbors will move depending on the mass of the nodes and the forces applied. Mass aggregates are used for many different
						objects that rigid bodies cannot recreate. Examples of these include:
					</p>
					
					<ul class="main_bullet_points"> 
						<li>
							Cloth and Rope
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									Cloth and rope are examples of common dynamic objects that need to deform around their environment within the physics simulation.
									In most modeling programs, cloth is dropped over an environment and each node will interact with the environment when it collides
									with other physics objects, deforming it.
								</li>
								<li>
									Cloth and rope can often be converted into a rigid body if it is used statically with no dynamic movement, but it best for it to 
									start as a mass aggregate as it will automatically deform around the other objects in it's environment, instead of modeling it
									from scratch.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Destructables
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									Objects or scenes that are destructable are very common in simulations when testing collisions for real world purposes, including
									safety features, product tests, and architectural purposes. Most CAD tools rely more on mass aggregates than rigid bodies for this
									reason.
								</li>
								<li>
									 While games can get away with using rigid bodies, by swapping out the model with a premade destrotyed model, simulations cannot, as
									 it is important to accurately deform these objects around the node of intersection, so this would not work.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Particle and Fluid Dynamics
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									Particle and fluid dynamics are the most intensive mass aggregates to simulate, as in order to accurately simulate fluids or gases, even in 
									small containers, thousands of nodes are needed sometimes millions. This is because the nodes move rapidly, turbulantly, and divergently.
								</li>
								<li>
									No game, simulation, or animation program is currently rendering fluids in real time with ray tracing, as no matter what acceleration structures 
									used (discussed in collision detection), they cannot be made fast enough with current hardware. Houdini by SideFX, the best renderer for particles
									and fluids, requires a minimum of 64 GB DDR5 RAM for these types of simulations.
