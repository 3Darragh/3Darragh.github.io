				What is Collision Detection?
			</h2>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
					Collision detection consists of the tests and processes to optimally detect if two volumes will collide,
					when they will collide, and how they will collide. This involves determining if they are moving along any
					path where they can collide, where on their path they could collide, and at what points they will collide.
					To make these tests optimal for real time use, different structures and techniques are employed, including
					bounding volumes, intersection tests, bounding volume hierarches, and spatitial partitioning structures. 
					This section will give an overview on how each of these are implemented.

					<h2>
						Bounding Volumes
					</h2>
					
					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
						Bounding volumes (BVs) are simplified shapes that overlap every object in the scene. BVs are constructed
						with math functions, instead of specific geometric points like meshes, so the engine can determine if the
						two objects could be colliding with less resources. Since they completely overlap the objects, if two
						bounding volumes are not overlapping, then the objects cannot overlap, and the test is performed far more
						efficiently. BVs are chosen by how close they look to the object they are overlapping, and by how optimized
						they are. Below is a table of all 3D BVs and how efficient they are. 2D BVs are excluded due to being mostly
						the same but with less dimensions.

					<h2>
						Intersection tests
					</h2>
					
					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
						After establishing all BVs in a scene, tests need to be performed to see if they are currently intersecting.
						To do this, different tests are written for each combination of bounding volumes, as well as lines, segments,
						rays, and planes. This results in 120 total intersections tests. Some can be copied over, like all tests on
						cylinders can apply to infinite cylinders, but since cylinders need to test the cylinder caps and track it's 
						length along a vector, creating a custom file for tests like this is more optimal as it has less bloat.
						The list below compares three different intersection tests and lists when to use them.
					</p>
						
					<ul class="main_bullet_points"> 
						<li>
							Seperating Axis Theorum:
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									The seperating axis theorum (SAT) test asserts that if a plane can seperate two bounding volumes, 
									then the objects are not intersecting. Since generating a plane is more expensive, we instead find 
									the axis of the plane that seperates the objects.
								</li>
								<li>
									The SAT test can be used on most BVs and is simple to code, but has some limitations. It cannot be
									used on any object of infinite length or any concave object, so it cannot be used on infinite cylinders,
									infinte cones, and circle swept spheres.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="main_bullet_points"> 
						<li>
							Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi Algorithm:
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									The Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm builds a tetrahedron within the minkowski difference of the 
									objects. If the origin of the coordinate space lies within this shape, the objects are intersecting. If
									they are not colliding, the closest points to the origin are the closest points between the two objects.
								</li>
								<li>
									The GJK algorithm can be used in many situations, like when the SAT test doesn't work, when you need to find
									the closest points between two objects during intersection, when you don't want to rely on vertex or face
									values, or when you plan to use the next algorith, the EPA test, afterwards.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="main_bullet_points"> 
						<li>
							Expanding Polytope Algorithm:
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									The Expanding Polytope Algorithm (EPA) test is used after the GJK algorithm concludes that objects are colliding.
									It takes the tetrahedron formed by GJK and finds the intersection volume and other information that the GJK
									cannot assertain.
								</li>
								<li>
									The EPA test is used when more information is needed than just intersection status. This includes the intersection
									normal for reflections, the contact point to apply forces at, or the pennetration depth to see how deep it intersects.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="main_bullet_points"> 
						<li>
							Sweep Test:
							<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
								<li>
									When objects are moving at high speeds against static objects, the sweep test is used. Using shapecasts or ray casting, 
									the test checks the objects trajectory over time to see if it will hit an object.
								</li>
								<li>
									Sweep tests are done when the object is at risk of tunneling through other objects when other tests are used. Its also
									used when the other objects in the scene are all static, as the sweep test works better against these.
								</li>

							Bounding Volume Hierarchies
						</h2>
						
						<p>
							&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
							Bounding volume hierachies (BVHs) are an acceleration structure that speeds up the detection system by ruling out large groups of 
							objects that cannot be intersecting. Unlike intersection tests, which narrowly check for collisions between two objects, BVHs are
							a broad phase structure that works by splitting the BVH into a tree with different types of nodes, and finding ways to exit the check 
							early if there are no collisions.
						</p>
						
						<ul class="main_bullet_points"> 
							<li>
								Leaf Nodes:
								<ul class="sub_bullet_points">
									<li>
										Leaf nodes are the nodes that are at the bottom of the tree which represent each individual BV. If there the program does not
										exit early, then potentially colliding root nodes are tested like traditional intersection tests. The BVH is constructed bottom
										up, which means it starts with the leaf nodes and builds upwards to the top of the tree.
